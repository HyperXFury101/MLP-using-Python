# MLP-using-Python
Python Project based on Decision Tree.
This code is a beginner-friendly example of a machine learning classification task. It trains a decision tree to predict iris species, checks its performance, and visualizes the decision rules. The goal is to learn how to build, evaluate, and interpret a model using a standard dataset, with decision trees chosen for their simplicity and interpretability.
